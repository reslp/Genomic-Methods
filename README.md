### Contents

This module is part of the specialization in "Evolutionary Ecology" and the specialization in "Digital Biology."\
The focus of this module is on essential skills for producing as well as evaluating, organizing, and analyzing large biological datasets, with special attention, but not limited to, molecular biology data. Among others, the following topics will be covered:\
- Current technologies, methods, and databases in the field of DNA/RNA sequencing
- Fundamental algorithms in computer-assisted molecular biology
- Modern computer-assisted tools, applications, and computing infrastructure for large-scale analyses of DNA/RNA and other data
- Reproducibility in modern computer-assisted biology and data science in general

The module is devided into 3 individual lectures:

1. Genomic Methods in Evolutionary Biology and Ecology
2. Databases in Ecology and Comparative Genomics
3. Fundamentals of Reproducable Data Analysis

### Expected Learning Outcomes and Competencies

Upon completion of the module, students will be able to:\

- Design evolutionary biological and ecological studies based on DNA/RNA data
- Select appropriate sequencing technologies and applications for studies
- Evaluate high-throughput data (NGS) of various types (QC)
- Analyze high-throughput data (NGS) both qualitatively and quantitatively
- Explain and apply fundamental algorithms of computer-assisted molecular biology
- Interact with important public biological databases
- Use High Performance Computing infrastructure (HPC)
- Process large (biological) datasets efficiently and reproducibly
- Organize large (biological) datasets and utilize workflow management systems
- Use and develop software containers and computer-assisted automated workflows

### Teaching and Learning Activities, Methods

Lectures by teachers and students, a mix of interactive didactic teaching and guided practical work and exercises, independent work in small groups, writing of written assignments\
